## Some Words


In fact, I have a very special online habit and need a little Google service. However, I can also use these Internet products without Google (most Chinese people are not like this?). But what about those sites and accounts that use Google Gmail registration? Abandon it? Maybe I need to come up with a better solution to weigh it. To be honest, some of Google's products and services are really great, and I like it so much. But when I thought that my privacy was "stealed", I was heartbroken and prompted me to make some choices. For example, looking for Google's alternatives. Of course, there are many products that can find the ideal alternative, while others are not satisfactory. And some products require the Google service framework to run, which is really contradictory! However, since we have made a choice to compete with Google (of course not just Google, there are also include other companies) to protect our personal privacy, we have to do it. As far as I am concerned, I am not personally capable, but I hope that everyone can actively participate and fight for our privacy. 

Why not call it "Privacy Defense War", how do you think?
